The susceptibility values (Ï‡) for different magnets are:
Ferromagnets	 10^3  - 10^6 and more
Ferrimagnets	 10^3  - 10^5
Paramagnets	 10^-3 - 10^-5
Antiferromagnets       0
Diamagnets	-10^-5 - 10^-6


An example of ferrimagnet will be nearest neighbour ferromagnetic interaction and next nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction.

Here, I have made notes mostly from Ashcroft and Mermin, which covers:
1. Solids with magnetic field
2. Larmor Diamagnetism
3. Van-Vleck Paramagnetism
4. Curie's law for free ions
5. Curie's law in solids
6. Pauli Paramagnetism
7. Landau Diamagnetism
